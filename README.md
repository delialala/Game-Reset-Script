# Game-Reset-Script
Simple Python script for resetting a game when needed. Replace the path variable with the path to your own game. Once ran, the script will open your application of choice and will remain open until you either close the game or press ctrl + alt + i, at which point the current instance of your program will be closed and another one reopened.
